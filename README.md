About me
I'm Nicole Costa, a Computer Science undergrad at UDESC CCT with a deep interest in open source technology and community-driven projects. 
Iâ€™m currently leading Colmeia, our university's open-source community group, where I coordinate projects, organize events, and engage with students interested in open-source development.
